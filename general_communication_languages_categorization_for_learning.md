  A1[Very Consonant] --> B1[Very Non Tonal]
  A3[Very Vowelant] --> B3[Very Much Tonal]

  A1 & B1 --> C1[Easy to Learn] --> A1 & B2
  A3 & B3 --> C2[Harder to Learn] --> A1 & B2

We can put `A2[Very Phonetically Mixed] --> B2[Very Tonally Mixed]` between the first two childs of the first wrapper but we don't have too.<br>
it's just important to remember that there can be many intermediate categorizations btween the two children.
