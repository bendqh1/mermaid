From my experience, a General Communication Language (GCL) can be either:

1. Mixed but primarily consonant
1. Mixed but primarily vowelant
1. Mixed but primarily consonant-vowel conjoined

English and Russian are of type 1, while Thai and Vietnamese of type 3 and therefore type 1 speakers could learn each other's languages fast, but will have a hard time learning type 3 languages and vice versa.
