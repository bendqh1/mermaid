From my experience, a Human Vocal General Communication Language (HVGCL) can be either:

1. Primarily Consonant
1. Primarily vowelant
1. Primarily mixed with a tendency to consonant
1. Primarily mixed with a tendency to vowelant

English and Russian are of type 1, while Thai and Vietnamese of type 4 and thus we have three conclusions:

* Type 1 speakers could learn each others languages fast, but will have a hard time learning type 4 languages.
* Type 4 speakers could learn each others languages fast, but will have a hard time learning type 1 languages.

Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi are of type 3, so speakers of these languages could learn languages from type 1 and 4 quite fast.
